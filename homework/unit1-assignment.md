Tropical and temperate ecosystems differ dramatically in structure, productivity, and resilience. In both systems, energy transfer and nutrient cycling determine long-term stability. Scientists studying ecosystem dynamics have found that even small disturbances — such as the introduction of an invasive species or a temporary drought — can trigger cascading ecological effects.

### **(a)**

Explain how the *second law of thermodynamics* governs energy transfer in ecosystems.
In your explanation, connect this concept to **trophic efficiency** and **biomass distribution** among trophic levels.

---

### **(b)**

Compare how **energy flow** and **matter cycling** differ in open versus closed ecological systems.
Use a specific example (natural or human-influenced) to illustrate feedback loops that stabilize or destabilize system dynamics.

### **(c)**

An ecologist models two ecosystems — a tropical rainforest and a temperate grassland — and finds that the rainforest has higher **gross primary productivity (GPP)** but lower **net ecosystem productivity (NEP)** after disturbance.
Provide **two possible ecological explanations** for this observation.

---

### **(d)**

A temporary drought reduces soil moisture and nutrient mobility in a forest.
Discuss how this disturbance could alter **plant community composition**, **decomposer activity**, and **trophic pyramid structure** over the next 5–10 years.
In your answer, integrate at least **two feedback mechanisms** (positive or negative).

### **(e)**

Systems ecologists often describe ecosystems as “networks of feedbacks.”
Design a **conceptual diagram** illustrating at least **four interacting feedback loops** within an ecosystem (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, nutrient recycling).
Explain how **system resilience** emerges from the balance between these loops.
